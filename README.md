# epmap_modify

This utility is designed to modify epmap files, which are map profiling files used by euddraft.

Specifically, it corrects an issue introduced in version 0.10.0, where offsets are output in decimal format instead of hexadecimal. This tool restores the previous hexadecimal format used in versions prior to 0.9.9.
